# ~

I first saw [kubedoom](https://github.com/storax/kubedoom) and thought it was pretty cool, so I decided to do the same for Terraform, knowing that I was working with it for professional projects. 

The principle is very simple, each enemy represents a Terraform resource, if an enemy dies, the associated resource is destroyed.

# How it works ?

The main program is **`tf-doom`**', which creates a UNIX socket, listens to it and simultaneously launches an X11 virtual server (Xvfb), a VNC server (x11vnc) attached to this X session and **`psdoom`** (DOOM writing to the UNIX socket). 

Everything we've just described will be encapsulated in a Docker container.

The binaries **`Xvfb`** and **`x11vnc`** are used to create a cross-platform graphical access to **`psdoom`** inside the container.

**`psdoom`** will continuously write to the UNIX socket to signal **`tf-doom`** to send Terraform resource information. When an enemy is killed, **`psdoom`** writes the associated resource name to the socket.
