The aim of the project is to provide open source services to anyone who wants to use them. For the moment, the machine(s) used are small and consequently there are a limited number of services and features. This can of course evolve over time, depending on resources and motivation. So, if you're looking for performance above all else, I'd recommend [deuxfleurs.fr](https://deuxfleurs.fr/) or [chatons.org](https://www.chatons.org/). To use some of them, you'll need to send me an e-mail **`himself@theobori.cafe`** or **`nagi@tilde.team`**.

It's all about privacy and security. The aim is to be able to use simple and efficient services such as Joplin or SearXNG, but also to avoid Google, Microsoft, etc. Server configuration and DNS entries are automated and open source on GitHub. See [theobori-cafe organization](https://github.com/theobori-cafe).

Services status can be checked at [status.theobori.cafe](https://status.theobori.cafe).

While setting up the server(s) and services, I learned some interesting things about network and system security. By the way, an onion (Tor) service is available.

I've chosen to use a Joplin server instead of Nextcloud for lack of resources, and plan to have an instance as soon as possible!
